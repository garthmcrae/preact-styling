            If you need to build a lightweight and performant web application or
            web site and you are familiar with React this approach may be a
            viable solution for you. React No, **** **.

            For build we are using Vite the "next generation frontend tooling".
            It consists of a development server and "a build command that
            bundles your code with Rollup, pre-configured to output highly
            optimized static assets for production".
          </Paragraph>

            Rollup is also "the JavaScript module bundler". If I was to publish
            any of the files from this project to NPM I would use Rollup to
            bundle the module.

            Something I found really neat was Vite allows you to easily import
            raw files as a string so adding code examples to this project was a
            cinch, that being said when reviewing the bundle and testing I did
            observe that the string literals for the code aren't minified (which
            makes sense) and also render slowly.

            React? No â€” this is a Preact project not a React project. Preact is
            a "fast 3kB alternative to React with the same modern API". For an
            additional ~2kB you can include a React compatibility layer which
            means at surface level components look identical and can be copied
            and used in either React or Preact projects.
