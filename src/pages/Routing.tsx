            Routing allows users to navigate to and from pages within an
            application. A component or page based on a specific pathname
            entered via the URL or updated when a user clicks on a link. Routes
            can also be linked to when a user enters the application.

            A context provides the window's location pathname also listening to
            the popstate event to update when a user navigates back and forth
            using the browser controls.

            The routes component returns a child based on the current pathname.
            If no pathname exists it will route users to a not found pathname.

            Usage as follows. Note the trailing slashes â€” by default browsers
            add the trailing slash to pathnames on refresh. Defining paths with
            trailing slashes prevents the need to have additional logic to
            handle trailing slashes.

            The following can be used in conjunction with an anchor or called
            with a string for example on click or form submission. The window
            scroll position is also returned to zero.
