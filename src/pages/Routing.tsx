            Routing allows users to navigate to and from pages within an
            application. A component or page based on a specific pathname
            entered via the URL or updated when a user clicks on a link. Routes
            can also be linked to when a user enters the application.

              A context provides the window's location pathname also listening
              to the popstate event to update when a user navigates back and
              forth using the browser controls.

              Used in conjunction with an anchor is probably the most common use
              case although you can also call this with a string within a
              function for example a button click or form submission. Users
              scroll position is also returned to zero.

              The routes component returns a child based on the current
              pathname. If no pathname exists it will route users to a not found
              pathname.

              Usage as follows. Note the trailing slashes â€” by default browsers
              add the trailing slash to pathnames on refresh. Defining paths
              with trailing slashes prevents the need to have additional logic
              to handle trailing slashes.
